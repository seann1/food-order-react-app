## About The Project

A React app which displays data from a Firebase database. The app displays a list of restaurants. Each restaurant has a menu. A user can log in, add menu items from different restaurants to their cart, and place an order. Orders stored in the database. A logged in user can create a new restaurant. A new restaurant is created with a name, description, address and photo. The address field uses Google Places Autocomplete to generate suggestions for valid addresses. If a restaurant is created with a valid address, its location is geocoded using the Google Maps API, and its location is placed on a map of restaurants. Users can also upload additional photos for restaurants they have created.
